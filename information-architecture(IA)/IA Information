# Information Architecture (IA)

This section documents the Information Architecture for the hardware talent marketplace platform.

The IA was designed to support the unique behaviors of hardware founders who require:
- Clarity on available roles (embedded, PCB, mechanical, etc.)
- Trust signals before engaging (verification, case studies, pricing)
- Flexible search modes (AI-assisted or manual browsing)
- City-based discovery for local execution teams

The diagram outlines all relevant screens and logical paths, including:
- Landing and search flows
- Talent listings and filtering
- Profile detail and trust layers
- Communication and contact initiation
- Supporting pages (FAQ, dashboard, settings)

The goal of the IA is to create a scalable structure that reduces cognitive load while maintaining a high-trust decision flow.
