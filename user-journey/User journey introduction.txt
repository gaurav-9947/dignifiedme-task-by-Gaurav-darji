# User Journey Map

This folder contains the user journey map for the hardware talent platform concept.

The map follows a founder (Maya) who is building a home-cleaning robot prototype and needs embedded, PCB, and mechanical engineering support in her city.

The journey is broken into 5 stages:
1. Awareness
2. Research
3. Exploration
4. Evaluation
5. Decision

Each stage documents:
- Goals
- Actions
- Thoughts
- Pain points
- Touchpoints
- Opportunities

The purpose of this journey is to understand how hardware founders discover talent, evaluate credibility, and take high-trust next steps such as messaging, requesting proposals, or booking calls with verified engineers or cluster teams.
