# Hardware Talent Platform — Task Submission  
**Dignifiedme Technologies · Internship Assignment**

This repository contains my complete UX case study, research, and low-fidelity wireframes for the weekend task assigned by Dignifiedme Technologies.  
The project focuses on designing a city-based platform where hardware startups can discover verified freelancers or small cluster teams for embedded, PCB, mechanical, and robotics development.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Hardware founders often struggle to move from idea to execution because they don’t know:
- Which roles they need (embedded, PCB, firmware, mechanical, etc.)
- How to compare talent quality
- Whether to hire freelancers or cluster teams
- What realistic costs and timelines look like
- How to evaluate trust and past work

This solution is designed to:
- Provide AI and manual search modes  
- Surface verified hardware talent  
- Show trust signals (reviews, case studies, skill badges, availability)  
- Help founders understand costs, timelines, and collaboration models  
- Enable high-trust next steps (message, call, proposal)

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Design Approach

- **High-trust flow, not e-commerce**  
  Focus on conversation before commitment (message-first model).

- **Dual discovery path**  
  AI-assisted matching + manual filters for flexibility and clarity.

- **Trust-first interface**  
  Verification badges, reviews, case studies, pricing snapshots shown before CTAs.

- **City-based relevance**  
  Location captured directly in search to avoid unnecessary steps.

- **Cluster vs freelancer clarity**  
  Users can understand when to hire a team vs an individual.
